How to use 2-matrix_divided.py
===============================

This library only has one function called ``matrix_divided()``.
It takes 2 arguments, the first is a matrix (list of lists), and the second a number to divided the matrix.

Importing the function:
	>>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

division of matrix of integers:
	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	[[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

matrix with a string:
	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 'f']]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

uneven size of matrix:
	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

tuple in the list:
	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], (1, 2)]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

matrix of integers and floats:
	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3.9], [50.6, 20, 6]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
	[[0.33, 0.67, 1.3], [16.87, 6.67, 2.0]]

matrix divided by a negative number:
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, -3)
	[[-0.33, -0.67, -1.3], [-16.87, -6.67, -2.0]]

matrix divided by zero:
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

matrix divided by a string:
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 'f')
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: div must be a number

matrix divided by a float:
	>>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3.9], [50.6, 40, 6]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2.5)
	[[0.4, 0.8, 1.56], [20.24, 16.0, 2.4]]

NaN in matrix:
	>>> matrix = [[1, 'NaN', 3.9], [50.6, 40, 6]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

float overflow:
	>>> matrix = [[1, float('inf'), 3.9], [50.6, 40, 6]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
	[[0.5, inf, 1.95], [25.3, 20.0, 3.0]]

no matrix:
	>>> matrix = []
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	...
	IndexError: list index out of range

matrix of 1 list:
	>>> matrix = [[50.6, 40, 6]]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
	[[25.3, 20.0, 3.0]]

just a regulat list:
	>>> matrix = [50.6, 40, 6]
	>>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
	Traceback (most recent call last):
	TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats
